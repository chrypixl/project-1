# Book Search

One Paragraph of the project description

Initially appeared on
[gist](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2). But the page cannot open anymore so that is why I have moved it here.

## Getting Started

## User Story

As a shopper,
I want to be able to find the right book and purchase it as a gift.
As an avid reader,
I want to be able to find books published by my favorite author.
As a student,
I want to be able to search nonfiction books for educational materials.

## Acceptance Criteria

It is done when I search for books using the 'Title' criterion and I am presented with a list of books that have the exact same title.

It is done when I search for books using the 'Genre' criterion and I am presented with a list of books that fit the selected genre.

It is done when I search for a book using the 'Author' criterion and I am presented a list of books written by the author.

It is done when I search for a book by category and I am presented a list of books that fit the correct category- either Fiction or Non-fiction.

It is done when I can select a book title from the results and I am redirected to a Barnes and Noble store page where I can see if the book is available for purchase.

## Project Requirements

You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).

* Must include one modal. It does not use native browser alert, confirm, or prompt functionality.

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Individual Requirements

As an employee of your group you must:

* Communicate: You should be an active member of the Slack channel and discussion rooms. 

* Commit: Each individual should have a similar number of commits per project.

* Contribute: A minimum number of four (4) commits per person.

* Demo: Each member of the group must have a meaningful speaking role on presentation day.

* Reflect: Everyone will participate in a group "project retrospective."

## Presentation Requirements

Use this [project presentation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) to address the following: 

* Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application

* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

* Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

* Demo: Show your stuff!

* Directions for Future Development

* Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository
